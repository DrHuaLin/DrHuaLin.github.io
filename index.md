> Welcome to **Hua Lin**'s webpage. I am a developmental and family scientist and quantitative research methodologist, serving as a post-doctoral fellow at Oklahoma State University. 

## Research Interests

<a href="/home/"><img style="float: right; width: 550px; margin: 0px 5px 5px" src="images/Family3-1.jpg"></a>

> One of my research interests is the development of [**parent-child interactions**](/research/###The Development of Parent-child Interactions), in that I focus on momentary parenting goals, parental competency, and social withdrawal. I was certified by Active Parenting in 2015 for teaching “Active parenting 4th edition” and “Parenting Your 1- to 4-Year-Old.”
>
> My research interest in **immigrant family well-being** focuses on how immigrant-related stress impacts adolescent health and behavior and how a psycho-educational intervention can buffer against stress and/or ameliorate the effects of stress in immigrant families from a resilience perspective.
>
> My research interest in **quantitative methods** is enhancing causal evidence from non-randomized longitudinal research designs, cross-cultural psychometric appropriations (including Item Response Theory), and statistic model comparison (mediation moderation, propensity score matching, SEM models, HLM models, Latent class analysis, dual-centered ANCOVA, etc.). 

> I am also applying **statistical software** such as Stata, Mplus, R, SAS, and Python in research and teaching. I have been certified by Data Carpentry to teach data management and statistic programs in Data Carpentry Workshop (e.g., Introduction to R) and Software Workshop (e.g., Python).
