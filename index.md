## Research Interests
> One of my research interests is the development of parent-child interactions, in that I focus on momentary parenting goals, parental competency, and social withdrawal. I was certified by Active Parenting in 2015 for teaching “Active parenting 4th edition” and “Parenting Your 1- to 4-Year-Old.”
>
> My research interest in immigrant youth well-being focuses on how immigrant-related stress impacts Latinx adolescent health and behavior and how a psycho-educational intervention can buffer against stress and/or ameliorate the effects of stress in Latinx immigrant families from a resilience perspective.
>
> My research interest in quantitative methods is enhancing causal evidence from non-randomized longitudinal research designs, cross-cultural psychometric appropriations (including Item Response Theory), and statistic model comparison (mediation moderation, propensity score matching, SEM models, HLM models, Latent class analysis, dual-centered ANCOVA, etc.). 

> I am also applying statistical software such as Stata, Mplus, R, SAS, and Python in research and teaching. I have been certified by Data Carpentry to teach data management and statistic programs in Data Carpentry Workshop (e.g., Introduction to R) and Software Workshop (e.g., Python).
